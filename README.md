## void_ptr

I'm a game and software developement hobbyist.
I programm in mostly in C++ and GDScript even though I have learned multible other languages like:
    
    - Rust
    - C++
    - Python
    - GDScript
    - Swift
    - Lua

*(I hope that someday I'll find time to learn Haskell and Go.)*

Recently I got an obsession with making useless shader and post processing effects.
You can find all the public ones in voidxptr/shaders.
My goal currently is to commit atleast once a day.

Keep in mind I'm still learning its not the best code, but I hope its not as bad as YandereDev.
