## voidxptr

I'm a game and software developement hobbyist.

I programm in mostly in C and GDScript even though I have learned multible other languages like:
    
    - C
    - GDScript
    - C++
    - Python
    - Lua
*(I hope that someday I'll find time to learn Haskell and Zig.)*

<br/>

My goals currently are:

    - To commit more than like once in a blue moon.
    - To actually finish one of my projects.
    - To climb to the skill level needed to actually commit on other repos.

<br/>

*Please keep in mind I'm still learning it's not goint to be best code.*

*But this does not mean that I would not be happy about feedback / suggestions (quite the contrary).*
