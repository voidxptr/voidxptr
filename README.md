## void_ptr

I'm a game and software developement hobbyist.
I programm in mostly in C++ and GDScript even though I have learned multible other languages like:
    
    - Rust
    
    - Python
    
    - Swift
    
    - Lua

Recently I got an obsession with making useless shader and post processing effects.
You can find all the public ones in voidxptr/shaders.

Keep in mind I'm still learning its not the best code, but I hope its not as bad as YandereDev.
